# CONCURRENCY PROBLEMS

### 1. Dining Philosophers Problem

**a. Description of the Problem:**
Multiple philosophers are sitting at a round table, each with a fork between them and their neighbor. Philosophers think and occasionally stop to eat. To eat, a philosopher needs both forks. The challenge is to ensure all philosophers get a chance to eat without deadlock.

**b. Concrete Example in Software Engineering:**
In a multi-threaded environment, multiple threads (philosophers) might need exclusive access to multiple resources (forks) to execute a task (eat).

**c. Challenging Part of this Problem:**
Ensuring all threads can access the resources they need without causing a deadlock (all threads waiting on each other, unable to proceed) or resource contention.

### 2. Producer-Consumer Problem

**a. Description of the Problem:**
There's a buffer shared between producers and consumers. Producers add items to the buffer, and consumers remove items. Synchronization is needed to ensure proper access.

**b. Concrete Example in Software Engineering:**
Message Queues like RabbitMQ or Kafka. Producers push messages to the queue, and consumers pull and process these messages.

**c. Challenging Part of this Problem:**
Ensuring synchronization such that consumers don't try to consume when the buffer is empty and producers don't produce when the buffer is full, potentially leading to data loss or overflows.

### 3. Readers-Writers Problem

**a. Description of the Problem:**
A shared resource can be accessed by multiple readers or a single writer, but not simultaneously. The challenge is ensuring both read and write access without conflict.

**b. Concrete Example in Software Engineering:**
A configuration file that multiple services read, but only one admin service can update. The system must prevent read operations during a write.

**c. Challenging Part of this Problem:**
Balancing fairness between readers and writers to avoid scenarios where a writer or reader is perpetually starved of access.

### 4. Sleeping Barber Problem

**a. Description of the Problem:**
A barber can only cut one person's hair at a time. If there are no customers, the barber sleeps. When a customer arrives, if the barber is asleep, they wake the barber up; otherwise, they wait or leave if the shop is full.

**b. Concrete Example in Software Engineering:**
Thread pooling where threads (barbers) are asleep when not in use. Incoming tasks (customers) wake up a thread or wait if all threads are busy.

**c. Challenging Part of this Problem:**
Ensuring efficient resource (thread) usage without causing deadlocks or excessive waiting times for tasks.

### 5. Bridge Crossing Problem

**a. Description of the Problem:**
A narrow bridge can be crossed by one entity at a time, either from the left or right. Entities coming from opposite directions must coordinate to prevent a collision.

**b. Concrete Example in Software Engineering:**
Network traffic management where data packets (entities) traverse a constrained bandwidth channel (bridge) without causing collisions.

**c. Challenging Part of this Problem:**
Coordinating the traffic flow to ensure maximum throughput while preventing data collisions and ensuring fairness between packets from different directions.
